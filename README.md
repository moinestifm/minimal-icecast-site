# Minimal Icecast Site
super minimal site for icecast, used for lightweight devices
(its super lightweight but ugly)

## how to use

1. open `index.html` or `index.min.html`
2. replace the `STREAM_URL` with your icecast mount point:
3. change the `interval` if you want to reduce stress on icecast server

```js
const STREAM_URL = "http://yourserver:port/mountpoint";
```

please dont just steal this.. atleast credit stef or moinesti fm
